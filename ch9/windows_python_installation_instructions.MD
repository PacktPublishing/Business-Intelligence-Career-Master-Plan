## Installing Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Windows

### Step 1: Download Python

1. Open a web browser and go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/.
2. Click on the "Downloads" tab on the navigation bar.
3. Scroll down and choose the latest stable version of Python for Windows. For example, as of now, you can choose Python 3.9.7.
4. Click on the download link for the Windows installer that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If you're unsure about your system architecture, you can check it by going to "Control Panel > System and Security > System".
5. Once the download is complete, run the installer.

### Step 2: Installing Python

1. Run the Python installer that you downloaded in the previous step.
2. In the installer, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" and select the option "Install Now".
3. The installer will start installing Python on your system. This process may take a few minutes.
4. Once the installation is complete, you will see a "Setup was successful" message. Click on the "Close" button.

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation

1. Open the Command Prompt by pressing the Windows key + R, typing "cmd", and hitting Enter.
2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```python
   python --version
   ```
   This command will display the version of Python installed on your system. If it shows the version number (e.g., Python 3.9.7), Python is successfully installed.

### Step 4: Installing Jupyter Notebooks

1. Open the Command Prompt.
2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```python
   pip install jupyter
   ```
   This command will install Jupyter Notebooks using the pip package manager.

### Step 5: Launching Jupyter Notebooks

1. Open the Command Prompt.
2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```python
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server.
3. The Jupyter Notebook interface will open in your default web browser.
4. You can create a new notebook by clicking on the "New" button and selecting "Python 3" under the "Notebooks" section.
5. You can now start writing code in Jupyter Notebooks.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Python, as well as Jupyter Notebooks, on your Windows machine. You are now ready to start using Jupyter Notebooks for Python programming and data analysis.

Remember to periodically update Python and Jupyter Notebooks to the latest versions to take advantage of new features and security updates.
